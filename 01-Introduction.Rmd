# Introduction

### Goal of the Supplemental Handbook

The goal of this supplemental handbook is to provide students with advice regarding the most critical areas of professional development during a graduate program in clinical psychology.  The supplemental handbook does not set any academic standards but more the professional standards that Dr. Bedics has identified as most critical to your sucess throughout the program.

### Graduate School for the Millenial/Post-Millenial Generation

Graduate school is like no other time in your life and you can make of it what you will.  The difference between students is often in how they structure their time and life to support and motivate academic learning. 


There are a few things working against students.  First, you have a large class size and so it's easy to fall into undergraduate mode and do the same thing you did in graduate school as you did in undergraduate.  Graduate school requires active participation in class and engagement with all the material and your demonstration of that in the class to the instructor.  Second, never before have there been more opporunities for distraction through entertainment.  The management of your time and how you avoid/eliminate these distractions is a skill.  Third, graduate school assumes success in the classroom and going well beyond with extra reading, making that paper for class better and taking it to the next level, and developing your own projects independent of classrooms.  Again, it's how you structure your time and it's completely noticeable to someone like your program director and will make the difference between a four line letter of recommendation or a 4-paragraph letter of recommendation.
