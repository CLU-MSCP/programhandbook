### Goal of the Supplemental Handbook

The goal of this supplemental handbook is to provide students with advice regarding the most critical areas of professional development during a graduate program in clinical psychology.  The supplemental handbook does not set any academic standards but more the professional standards that Dr. Bedics has identified as most critical to your sucess throughout the program.

### Graduate School for the Millenial/Post-Millenial Generation

Graduate school is like no other time in your life and you can get out of it what you put into it. However, if you don't know *how* then you have little chance of being successful. The supplemental manual is meant to give you advice on how to improve your performance.
