# Doctoral Work

## Letters of Recommendation

1. Plan ahead: Ask for a letter in **October**.

2. Submit all applications and letter requests from the school to the recommender by **11/15** (at the latest) for programs that have a deadline of 12/1.  Dr. Bedics will not provide letters for requests sent from schools after 11/15 regardless of the deadline.

3. If the doctoral schools requires letters to scanned or mailed then you should give your referees a month notice and you should provide all the materials need including a signed waiver of rights to read the letter.

4. Always waive your rights to read the letter.

5. Buy an actual "thank you card" to say **THANK YOU** to your recommenders and send it/give it to them.

### Pro Tips for Letters of Recommendation

Here's what I'd like to say for letters of recommendation. The student:

1. was always professional in all interactions and polite.

2. was timely in all interactions.

3. showed improvement throughout my time knowing them and helped me understand how they improved.

4. acted independently and at the same time asked for help when appropriate.

5. went beyond classroom material to embrace assignments and readings in new ways.

6. actively participated in class every week.

7. clearly engaged the material by taking notes, bringing a textbook that was outlined and marked-up.  You never get points for "renting" a book but you can make up for it by demonstrating how you take notes and engage in material.  Dr. Bedics often has extra copies if you need a book.

8. demonstrated the ability to motivate themselves and create an environment that supports academic work (reading for fun) rather than leisure (watching netflix).

## Finding a Program

1. Apply to range of schools based on overall competitiveness.  Range can be decided by ratio of applied to admitted or GRE scores.
2. For PhD programs, you are applying to work for a faculty member.
3. For PsyD programs, you are applying because you appreciate the mission of the school and program. 

## Curriculum Vita

1. Follow the template provided by Dr. Bedics.
2. Aesthetics matter most

## Personal Statement

The personal statement you wrote for the MSCP program is not adequate for a doctoral program.  Please see Dr. Bedics for revisions and feedback.

## Consultation

You should request to meet with Dr. Bedics to review your material in October.
