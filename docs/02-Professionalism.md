# Professionalism

Many of these points might seem like commonsense.  If they do they that's great for you and it can only reinforce what you're already doing well.  Many people, however, are not aware of such formalities that increase your likelihood of success in the program. 

The rules follow for all staff and faculty at CLU.  Dr. Bedics continually checks in on your professionalism throughout the program by talking to office staff like our program specialist in the Bell House and your instructors. 


### Overall

Everything in life is never perfect or exactly how we would like it.  Dr. Bedics is more concerned about how you handle adversity/unexpected life events rather than whether or not you were lucky enough to have everything go smoothly during the program.

Avoid judgmental language of other people such as peers, staff, or the school.  You can have a contagious effect on those around and it is something Dr. Bedics dislikes the most and will surely sink any letter of recommendation.
