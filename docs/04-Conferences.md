# Conferences

Everyone loves to attend conferences.  There are several things you can do to improve your success in attending a conference. 

1. Always ask your faculty advisor if you can submit your work to a conference even after you graduate.  The data is not yours and nothing you have done at CLU has been accomplished in isolation of others.  
2. Ask your mentore at least a month in advance.  Conference presentations require a lot of preparation.
3. You can only submit for conferences on projects where you have data and results!  It is very rare that anyone is able to submit to a conference for the masters thesis in the Fall of their second because the majority have not even gone through IRB yet!
4. Always include your faculty mentor as an author on the poster.
5. Know the relevant conferences ahead of time to help you plan.  The majority of students present at [APA](http://www.apa.org/convention/)  (December deadline for August), [APS](http://www.psychologicalscience.org/conventions/annual)  (January deadline for May), and [WPA](http://westernpsych.org/convention/) (November deadline for April)
