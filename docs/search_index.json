Dr. Bedics will not provide letters for requests sent from schools after 11/15 regardless of the deadline. If the doctoral schools requires letters to scanned or mailed then you should give your referees a month notice and you should provide all the materials need including a signed waiver of rights to read the letter. Always waive your rights to read the letter. 3.2 Finding a Program Apply to range of schools based on overall competitiveness. Range can be decided by ratio of applied to admitted or GRE scores. For PhD programs, you are applying to work for a faculty member. For PsyD programs, you are applying because you appreciate the mission of the school and program. 3.3 Curriculum Vita Follow the template provided by Dr. Bedics. Aesthetics matter most 3.4 Personal Statement The personal statement you wrote for the MSCP program is not adequate for a doctoral program. Please see Dr. Bedics for revisions and feedback. 3.5 Consultation You should request to meet with Dr. Bedics to review your material in October. "],
["conferences.html", "Section 4 Conferences", " Section 4 Conferences Everyone loves to attend conferences. There are several things you can do to improve your success in attending a conference. Always ask your faculty advisor if you can submit your work to a conference even after you graduate. The data is not yours and nothing you have done at CLU has been accomplished in isolation of others. Ask your mentore at least a month in advance. Conference presentations require a lot of preparation. You can only submit for conferences on projects where you have data and results! It is very rare that anyone is able to submit to a conference for the masters thesis in the Fall of their second because the majority have not even gone through IRB yet! Always include your faculty mentor as an author on the poster. Know the relevant conferences ahead of time to help you plan. The majority of students present at APA (December deadline for August), APS (January deadline for May), and WPA (November deadline for April) "]
