["introduction-1.html", "Section 1 Introduction", " Section 1 Introduction 1.0.1 Goal of the Supplemental Handbook The goal of this supplemental handbook is to provide students with advice regarding the most critical areas of professional development during a graduate program in clinical psychology. The supplemental handbook does not set any academic standards but more the professional standards that Dr. Bedics has identified as most critical to your sucess throughout the program. 1.0.2 Graduate School for the Millenial/Post-Millenial Generation Graduate school is like no other time in your life and you can get out of it what you put into it. However, if you don’t know how then you have little chance of being successful. The supplemental manual is meant to give you advice on how to improve your performance. "],
["professionalism.html", "Section 2 Professionalism", " Section 2 Professionalism Many of these points might seem like commonsense. If they do they that’s great for you and it can only reinforce what you’re already doing well. Many people, however, are not aware of such formalities that increase your likelihood of success in the program. The rules follow for all staff and faculty at CLU. Dr. Bedics continually checks in on your professionalism throughout the program by talking to office staff like our program specialist in the Bell House and your instructors. 2.0.1 Overall Everything in life is never perfect or exactly how we would like it. Dr. Bedics is more concerned about how you handle adversity/unexpected life events rather than whether or not you were lucky enough to have everything go smoothly during the program. Avoid judgmental language of other people such as peers, staff, or the school. You can have a contagious effect on those around and it is something Dr. Bedics dislikes the most and will surely sink any letter of recommendation. "],
["doctoral-work.html", "Section 3 Doctoral Work 3.1 Letters of Recommendation 3.2 Finding a Program 3.3 Curriculum Vita 3.4 Personal Statement 3.5 Consultation", " Section 3 Doctoral Work 3.1 Letters of Recommendation Plan ahead: Ask for a letter in October. Submit all applications and letter requests from the school to the recommender by 11/15 (at the latest) for programs that have a deadline of 12/1. Dr. Bedics will not provide letters for requests sent from schools after 11/15 regardless of the deadline. If the doctoral schools requires letters to scanned or mailed then you should give your referees a month notice and you should provide all the materials need including a signed waiver of rights to read the letter. Always waive your rights to read the letter. Buy an actual “thank you card” to say THANK YOU to your recommenders and send it/give it to them. 3.1.1 Pro Tips for Letters of Recommendation Here’s what I’d like to say for letters of recommendation. The student: was always professional in all interactions and polite. was timely in all interactions. showed improvement throughout my time knowing them and helped me understand how they improved. acted independently and at the same time asked for help when appropriate. went beyond classroom material to embrace assignments and readings in new ways. actively participated in class every week. clearly engaged the material by taking notes, bringing a textbook that was outlined and marked-up. You never get points for “renting” a book but you can make up for it by demonstrating how you take notes and engage in material. Dr. Bedics often has extra copies if you need a book. demonstrated the ability to motivate themselves and create an environment that supports academic work (reading for fun) rather than leisure (watching netflix). 3.2 Finding a Program Apply to range of schools based on overall competitiveness. Range can be decided by ratio of applied to admitted or GRE scores. For PhD programs, you are applying to work for a faculty member. For PsyD programs, you are applying because you appreciate the mission of the school and program. 3.3 Curriculum Vita Follow the template provided by Dr. Bedics. Aesthetics matter most 3.4 Personal Statement The personal statement you wrote for the MSCP program is not adequate for a doctoral program. Please see Dr. Bedics for revisions and feedback. 3.5 Consultation You should request to meet with Dr. Bedics to review your material in October. "],
["conferences.html", "Section 4 Conferences", " Section 4 Conferences Everyone loves to attend conferences. There are several things you can do to improve your success in attending a conference. Always ask your faculty advisor if you can submit your work to a conference even after you graduate. The data is not yours and nothing you have done at CLU has been accomplished in isolation of others. Ask your mentore at least a month in advance. Conference presentations require a lot of preparation. You can only submit for conferences on projects where you have data and results! It is very rare that anyone is able to submit to a conference for the masters thesis in the Fall of their second because the majority have not even gone through IRB yet! Always include your faculty mentor as an author on the poster. Know the relevant conferences ahead of time to help you plan. The majority of students present at APA (December deadline for August), APS (January deadline for May), and WPA (November deadline for April) "],
["classroom.html", "Section 5 Classroom", " Section 5 Classroom How to address your Instructors. Call your instructors by the proper title. If they are a PHD/PSYD then “Doctor” or “Professor” unless they tell you otherwise. Ask them if you’re unsure or just avoid actually saying their name. In-Class. Avoid excessive computer time. If you are staring at your computer in class and look overly happy then it’s likely that you’re not listening and are a distraction to your instructor. Even if you can listen, it doesn’t matter as you might be a distraction to your instructor. Involve yourself in class and throw yourself into the material. Timeliness. Be on time and leave on time. Let your instructor know if there’s anything that can disrupt the class. Missing Class. If you are sick, please let your instructor know in advance. Instructors want you to get better and they also don’t want you to get others sick. If something happens that requires you to miss class then email your instructor as soon as you can. Treat them like an employer. You do not have to share details of your private situation. Let Dr. Bedics know if anything comes up. Email Instructors. Always email from your CLU account. Addresss instructors with “Hello” and end with “Thank you” Act like a Graduate Student. How you manage your time and the time you put into your work is up to you. Instructors will notice what you do and do not do. We see minimum, less effort. We also see unread or unoutlined books. Similarly, we see and notice when you read, participate, ask questions, and go beyond what was expected. In my experience, it’s not so much a matter of aptitude but how you manage your time and motivated yourself. I comment most on this in letters of recommendation. "]
