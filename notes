There are a few things working against students.  

First, you have a large class size and so it's easy to fall into undergraduate mode and do the same thing you did in graduate school as you did in undergraduate.  Graduate school requires active participation in class and engagement with all the material and your demonstration of that in the class to the instructor.  

Second, never before have there been more opporunities for distraction through entertainment.  The management of your time and how you avoid/eliminate these distractions is a skill.  Third, graduate school assumes success in the classroom and going well beyond with extra reading, making that paper for class better and taking it to the next level, and developing your own projects independent of classrooms.  Again, it's how you structure your time and it's completely noticeable to someone like your program director and will make the difference between a four line letter of recommendation or a 4-paragraph letter of recommendation.
